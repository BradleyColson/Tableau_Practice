# Tableau_Practice

I've studied a lot from Data Analyst YouTubers such as "Alex the Analyst" and "Lore So What" who are active leaders in their field.  They both stated that Tableau is more popular in the workplace than Power BI.  

So, I took a data set called Credit Risks from Kaggle to practice Tableau.  Kaggle is know for pretty clean data, but data cleaning what's my goal.

The dashboard is posted here.

I asked the following question:

What was the most common reason to get a loan?
What was the interest rate for varities of incomes?
How many loans are defaulting and how are they grouped?
Lastly I asked how big the loan was versus the income?

I took presumbly fake data about airlines from Kaggle.  I did several queries about delays and destinations and then imported it into Tableau.

I looked into insights about:

  Which airline is the most on time?
  Which arrival airport has the fewest delays?
  What were the minimum, average, and maximum arrival delays?
  What time of days are most delays occurring?
  Which airline is usually on time which one is not?

Asian Air Pollution

Is the perception that air quality is dirty in China and India correct?

I took a kaggle data set to explore.

Cleaned data by checking column names and typos. Removed nulls.

Wrote sql query to establish average air quality per country and per city.

While China and India do have poor air quality on a city level, as a country it averages out below an unhealthy air index level.

The purpose of this dashboard was to get practice with geographical maps in Tableau and using sql case statements to create a color coded shading opportunity in the dashboard.
