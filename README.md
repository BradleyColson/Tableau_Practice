# Tableau_Practice


I took a data set called Credit Risks from Kaggle to practice Tableau.  Kaggle is know for pretty clean data, but data cleaning what's my goal.

The dashboard is posted here.

I asked the following questions:



What was the most common reason to get a loan?

Personal loans were the biggest reason to borrow.



What was the interest rate for varieties of incomes?

Most loans were mid level interest, followed by high interest, low interest was the lowest which makes sense.



How many loans are defaulting and how are they grouped?

Debt consolidation default rate was even. While Personal loans had the longest loan term or age.


Lastly I asked how big the loan was versus the income?

The larger the loan the lower the higher percentage of income was borrowed.

I took Kaggle data about airlines.

I did several queries about delays and destinations and then imported it into Tableau.

I looked into insights about:


Which airline is the most on time?
Delta Airlines had one flight that was always on time or early.


Which arrival airport has the fewest delays?
AVL airport had the fewest delays.


What were the minimum, average, and maximum arrival delays?

Min flight delay was pretty even across all airlines.

Average delay 


  What time of days are most delays occurring?
  Which airline is usually on time which one is not?

Asian Air Pollution

Is the perception that air quality is dirty in China and India correct?

I took a kaggle data set to explore.

Cleaned data by checking column names and typos. Removed nulls.

Wrote sql query to establish average air quality per country and per city.

While China and India do have poor air quality on a city level, as a country it averages out below an unhealthy air index level.

The purpose of this dashboard was to get practice with geographical maps in Tableau and using sql case statements to create a color coded shading opportunity in the dashboard.
