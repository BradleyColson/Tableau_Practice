# Tableau_Practice

I've studied a lot from Data Analyst YouTubers such as "Alex the Analyst" and "Lore So What" who are active leaders in their field.  They both stated that Tableau is more popular in the workplace than Power BI.  

So, I took a data set called Credit Risks from Kaggle to practice Tableau.  Kaggle is know for pretty clean data, but data cleaning what's my goal.

The dashboard is posted here.

I asked the following question:

What was the most common reason to get a loan?
What was the interest rate for varities of incomes?
How many loans are defaulting and how are they grouped?
Lastly I asked how big the loan was versus the income?

I took presumbly fake data about airlines from Kaggle.  I did several queries about delays and destinations and then imported it into Tableau.

I looked into insights about:

  Which airline is the most on time?
  Which arrival airport has the fewest delays?
  What were the minimum, average, and maximum arrival delays?
  What time of days are most delays occurring?
  Which airline is usually on time which one is not?
